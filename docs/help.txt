It's just a simple Hook for integration of smilies.

For using BBSmile please note the <img> tag must be allowed with attributes in the Zikula security settings

You can define your own shortcuts and aliases for them as well as an alt text for
the images. These alternate text may start with a _ and will be treated as a
define in this case to make it multilingual.
You can also (de-)activate the additional smilies one by one.
